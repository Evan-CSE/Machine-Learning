We have to face some situations where we can't classify our dataset into just 2 sections. We need to consider more and more classifications. For example we may are given sample data set where we are considering salaries for different companys for different roles. Now we want to predict salary if a specific company is interested to pay an assumed salary for given qualification. Here we have to consider many types of inputs to finally give an output. So we need to make decision after which criteria where to move. This can be done with decision tree. For more clarification
